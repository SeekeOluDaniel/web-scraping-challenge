### Tools
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Chrome Driver
3. HTML
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib


### Analysis

*Step by step processes are provided within the Jupyter notebooks.

I set out to:

1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

I attempted to extract the the headings and data rows together in order to create a Pandas DataFrame, but had to consult a learning assistant, who suggested to add the column names separately:

Part 2 - Cells 5 and 8 [separate the data rows and return only the data-rows from the table, and not the entire table (with the headings)]
